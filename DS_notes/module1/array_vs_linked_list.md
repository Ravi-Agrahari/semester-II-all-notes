**Arrays vs Linked Lists**

1. **Memory Allocation:**
   - Arrays: Contiguous block of memory, static or dynamic allocation.
   - Linked Lists: Collection of nodes, dynamically allocated.

2. **Size Flexibility:**
   - Arrays: Fixed size, cannot change dynamically.
   - Linked Lists: Dynamically grow or shrink in size.

3. **Access Time:**
   - Arrays: Constant time access using indexing.
   - Linked Lists: Linear time traversal from head to access elements.

4. **Insertion and Deletion:**
   - Arrays: Shifting elements, higher time complexity.
   - Linked Lists: Efficient insertion and deletion, especially at the beginning or end.

5. **Memory Overhead:**
   - Arrays: Less memory overhead, may have unused space.
   - Linked Lists: Additional overhead due to storing pointers.

6. **Contiguity:**
   - Arrays: Contiguous memory, cache-friendly.
   - Linked Lists: Non-contiguous memory, potential cache misses.

7. **Insertion Order Preservation:**
   - Arrays: Preserve insertion order.
   - Linked Lists: Also preserve insertion order.

8. **Dynamic Memory Management:**
   - Arrays: Manual memory management for dynamic arrays.
   - Linked Lists: Natural memory management for dynamic size.

9. **Traversal Complexity:**
   - Arrays: Constant-time access, straightforward traversal.
   - Linked Lists: Linear-time traversal through nodes.

10. **Usage Scenarios:**
    - Arrays: Fixed size, random access.
    - Linked Lists: Dynamic size, efficient insertion/deletion.
