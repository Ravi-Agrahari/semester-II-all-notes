Introduction and Explanation:
Understanding the folder structure of a Django project is essential for navigating and managing the project efficiently. Django projects consist of multiple apps, each with a specific purpose.

Key Points:
- The main project directory contains settings, URLs, and WSGI configuration.
- Each app within the project has its own models, views, templates, static files, and tests.
- The folder structure promotes modularity and reusability.

# Django Project Folder Structure:

    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    myapp/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        templates/
            myapp/
                home.html
        static/
            myapp/
                style.css

# Description of Key Files and Directories:
- manage.py: Command-line utility for interacting with the project.
- myproject/: Main project directory.
  - __init__.py: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - settings.py: Configuration settings for the project.
  - urls.py: URL declarations for the project.
  - wsgi.py: WSGI configuration for deploying the project.
- myapp/: A Django application within the project.
  - admin.py: Configuration for the admin interface.
  - apps.py: Application configuration.
  - models.py: Data models for the application.
  - tests.py: Tests for the application.
  - views.py: Views for handling requests and responses.
  - migrations/: Database migration files.
  - templates/: HTML templates for the application.
  - static/: Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) for the application.

Summary:
The Django folder structure is designed to promote organized and modular development. Each project consists of a main directory and multiple apps, each with its own set of components for handling different aspects of the application.
