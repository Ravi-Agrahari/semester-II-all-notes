Introduction and Explanation:
Python Interpreter and Interactive Mode:
- Python interpreter executes Python code line by line.
- Interactive mode allows immediate code execution and exploration.

Comments:
- Comments in Python start with `#` and are ignored during execution.
- Used for documenting code, adding explanations, and disabling code temporarily.

Identifiers and Keywords:
- Identifiers are names used for variables, functions, classes, etc., following specific rules.
- Keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, `def`).

Summary:
Python interpreter executes code interactively, comments aid in code understanding, and identifiers follow naming rules while keywords have predefined meanings.
