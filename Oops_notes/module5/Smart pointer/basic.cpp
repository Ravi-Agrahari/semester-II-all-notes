/*
    Smart pointer 
        - used for resource allocation 
        - If more than one pointer points to a same variable with same address , then is called a shared pointer .

        Example :
            int a = 10 ;
            int *q = &a; 
            int *p = &a ; 


    3 types of pointers are there .
        -unique pointer 
        -shared pointer 
        -weak pointer
