### Iterator 

    Iterators are objects that point to elements within a container. They are used to traverse containers. Types of iterators include:

    Input Iterators: Read from the container.
    Output Iterators: Write to the container.
    Forward Iterators: Traverse forward.
    Bidirectional Iterators: Traverse both forward and backward.
    Random Access Iterators: Directly access any element.
