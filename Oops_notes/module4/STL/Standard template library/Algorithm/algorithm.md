###  Algorithm:

    Algorithms are functions that perform operations on containers. They are generic, meaning they work with any container type that supports the required operations. Examples include:

    Searching (find, binary_search)
    Sorting (sort, stable_sort)
    Modifying (copy, fill, replace)
    Other utilities (accumulate, distance)
