#Container

    Containers are data structures that store collections of objects. They manage the storage space for their elements and provide member functions to access and manipulate these elements.
    
    The main types of containers are:

        1.Sequence Containers: Maintain the order of elements.

            array
            vector
            deque
            list
            forward_list

        2.Associative Containers: Maintain sorted order of elements.

            set
            multiset
            map
            multimap

        3.Unordered Associative Containers: Do not maintain order but allow fast retrieval.

            unordered_set
            unordered_multiset
            unordered_map
            unordered_multimap

        4.Container Adaptors: Provide a different interface for sequential containers.

            stack
            queue
